This project presents a comprehensive **cost-benefit analysis dashboard** for HealthFit’s proposed IPL-themed energy drink campaign using **Microsoft Excel**. The goal was to compare the financial performance of the **Old Plan** (without IPL marketing) vs. the **New Plan** (with IPL packaging and promotion) for two products—**HappyGrow** and **PowerSip**—across multiple cities.
